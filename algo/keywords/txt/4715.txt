In mathematics, a sequence a0, a1, ..., an of nonnegative real numbers is called a logarithmically concave sequence, or a log-concave sequence for short, if ai2 &gt; ai−1ai+1 holds for 1 &lt; i &lt; n − 1.
Examples of log-concave sequences are given by the binomial coefficients along any row of Pascal's triangle.
