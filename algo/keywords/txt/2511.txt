In mathematics, the Mahler polynomials gn(x) are polynomials introduced by Mahler (1930) in his work on the zeros of the incomplete gamma function.
Mahler polynomials are given by the generating function



Mahler polynomials can be given as the Sheffer sequence for the functional inverse of 1+t–et (Roman 1984, 4.9).
The first few examples are (sequence A008299 in OEIS)
