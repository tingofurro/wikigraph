	<span>Welcome to Wikigraph!</span><br />
	With Wikigraph, the goal is to view Mathematics as a giant graph. Each node is an Article in Wikipedia about a Mathematics subject, and each edge is a web link from one page to the other.
	<br /><br />
	Here are some we are looking at:<br /><br />
	<li /> Is there any apparent structure to the graph, if so, is it the conventional way we think of Mathematics fields (Algebra, Analysis, Discrete Math ...)
	<li /> Using Graph algorithms and Natural Language Processing tools, is it possible to recover "subfields/areas" of Mathematics. If so, how do these interact.
	<li /> Given a class Syllabus (text) or a Mathematics paper, is it possible to place it on the graph, and structure the information.
	<li /> Given a piece of knowledge, is it possible to build a tree of knowledge needed to learn this information?<br /><br />
	Curious? Here's where to find the code:<br />
